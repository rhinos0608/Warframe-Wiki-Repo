# Cedo

Launch a glaive that ricochets off surfaces in bursts of elemental damage, then perforate enemies with primary fire’s precision buck-shot. Damage increases with each Status Effect afflicting a target. Lavos will transmute a small portion of any ammo pickup to Primary Ammo when wielding his signature Cedo.
