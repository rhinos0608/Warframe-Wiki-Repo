# Felarx

The Felarx invokes ancient times when aristocrats hunted game. For ceremonies, Orokin elites bred creatures reminiscent of game birds to reanimate cultural myths. They gave the Zariman crew Felarx and a brace of birds as a sign of acceptance into elite society. The brace of birds becomes a pair of pistols at the hands of the Void.
