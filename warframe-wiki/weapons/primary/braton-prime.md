# Braton Prime

The **Braton Prime** is the Prime variant of the Braton assault rifle, featuring higher damage, critical chance, status chance, and magazine capacity, but with reduced fire rate compared to the original.

## Overview

Braton Prime is a reliable primary rifle known for balanced stats that excel in early to mid-game content and scale well with mods. As a Prime weapon, it offers significant improvements over its base variant while maintaining the familiar feel that makes the Braton series popular among Tenno.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- High magazine capacity (75 rounds)
- Balanced damage distribution across all physical damage types
- Good critical and status chance for hybrid builds
- Excellent ammunition efficiency
- Prime weapon bonus (+25% damage vs Orokin Void enemies)

### Disadvantages
- Moderate damage per shot compared to specialized weapons
- Lower fire rate than base Braton
- Requires significant mod investment to compete in high-level content
- Limited range falloff in open world areas

## Build Recommendations

The Braton Prime's balanced stats make it suitable for various build approaches:

### Critical Focus
Emphasize critical chance and critical damage multipliers to maximize single-target DPS. Hunter Munitions synergizes well with the weapon's decent critical stats.

### Status Focus
Leverage the weapon's status chance with multiple elemental mods to create powerful status combinations for crowd control and damage amplification.

### Hybrid Approach
The most versatile option, combining moderate critical and status chances for consistent performance across different enemy types and mission levels.

## Acquisition

Braton Prime is currently available through:
- Prime Vault (when unvaulted)
- Trading with other players
- Relic rewards (when in rotation)

## Trivia

- Braton Prime was one of the first Prime weapons introduced to Warframe
- It served as the baseline for many subsequent assault rifle designs
- Popular choice among new players transitioning to Prime weapons due to its forgiving nature
