# Innodem

In the early Orokin Empire, elites wore Innodem as a symbolic reminder to defend the defenseless. The tradition fell out of style, but nostalgic elites acknowledged the sentiment in the form of a gift. The Void amplifies that ideal. Void energy strengthens Innodem gliding aerial attacks and the wielder is increasingly resilient as they perform finisher attacks in Incarnon Form.
