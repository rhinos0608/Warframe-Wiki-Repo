# Pustulent Cognitive Nodule

The Infestation provokes the growth of multiple, seemingly redundant brain-like clusters, whose function may be linked to hivemind activity. 

Source: Cut from Aquapulmo and Cryptosuctus fish via Daughter in the Necralisk (Deimos). Catch Aquapulmo in Cambion Drift surface hotspots during Vome, and Cryptosuctus on the Cambion Drift surface during Fass. Also drops from Requiem Obelisks and Rolizor Infested Cysts in the Cambion Drift.
